                        <p>Ana Leite likes to invent new creations, find solutions where there are problems, disquiet if thereâ€™s a question and challenge if thereâ€™s margin. She looks for opportunities to work in a team and to develop new skills, from looking for contests and new projects, to volunteering and youth associationism. Furthermore, she has a degree in Communication Design and so is a newcomer to the so-called nine-to-five world (even that isnâ€™t quite how she thinks it is!)</p>

                    <p> In a pandemic context where the functioning of clubs was conditioned, a will was born to go back in the past and remember the crazy parties held at the Bairro Alto nightclub, FrÃ¡gil, a space of liberation, discovery and booster of Portuguese rock of the 80s and 90s. This photobook emerges from this revisiting of the past through texts and images made available by FrÃ¡gil in an online photographic collection (<a href="https://fragil.luxfragil.com/#/" target="_blank">fragil.luxfragil.com</a>ðŸ¡¥).

                    <p>Hence, this zine arises as a collective and under-construction reflection about design for the digital world, meeting dialogues and collection of references, which mark this moment of search about web design. It is split in two parts, the first one, about work and methodology processes, and the second one, a critical reflection on the development of design for digital.</p>

The collective born of the will to talk about contemporaneity and the artistic world. 0% appears as a starting point, as awareness that the learning is made of constant 0 points where new knowledge comes from. It is a space for discussion about Design and the Visual Arts, the media and people who think about them. </p>

                    <p>This website was developed in the context of my final degree project. Comes into shape by the expansion of wheel-change dynamics from collective conversations to a digital platform. It is a space of interaction, an archive of activities and references discussed.</p>
